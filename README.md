# AD-Sessional
Open ended project done towards Sessional Exam in Apllication Development Lab, KIIT
2. Procedure:
a. Gathered diverse plant leaf images representing: Different plant types (Bell
Pepper, Potato, Tomato), Various disease conditions, Healthy plant samples.
All of these are gathered from PlantVillage dataset of Kaggle.
b. Data Preprocessing: We then resize images to uniform dimensions (256x256
pixels, normalize pixel values, and augment data to increase training set
diversity.
c. We split the dataset into training and testing sets.
d. Implement a CNN model to learn the data, with cross entropy loss, and
procedures to stop overfitting.
e. Apply frontend html pages for web application, which includes index, login,
registration, and test
f. Save the trained model, develop a backend flask program that connects the
frontend and the trained model.
g. Using this backend, we le users login/register, and then we take user uploaded
image to detect plant disease with a certain level of confidence.
